----Node.js----
not a programming language
not a technology
not a framework
not a library
not a software

----IT IS JS RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT----
backend couldnt be done with js because it didnt have the functionalities for backend earlier
Ryan Dahl wanted to do backend using javascript.
Google chrome's v8 engine code is open source and Ryan Dahl tried modifying that code.
----BUT V8 ENGINE COE IS WRITTEN IN C++----
HE USED A WRAPPER(WRITTEN IN JS) ON V8 ENGINE CODE
----WE WILL BE WRITING JS CODE WHICH WILL BE RECEIVED BY THIS WRAPPER LAYER AND THAT CODE WILL CREATE A SERVER WITH THE C++ MODULES----

Node.js----> V8 engine + js Wrapper
backend can only be created till Node.js is running.
The time till which Node.js is going to have it runtime, it gives an environment to create a server using JavaScript.
Hence Node.js is a javscript runtime environment.

NO NODE.JS--->NO SERVER
